**Project Overview**  
This project is a personal portfolio website designed with a modern dark theme, featuring a hero section with a name and title, an about section, a skills section showcasing technology badges, and a contact form. The site uses responsive design principles for optimal viewing across devices and includes smooth visual effects using gradients and subtle animations.

**Setup Instructions**  
- Save the entire code above into an `.html` file, e.g., `index.html`.
- Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

**Usage Guide**  
- The hero section prominently displays your name.
- Scroll down to see the about section with a brief description.
- The skills section showcases badges of programming technologies.
- Fill out the contact form with your name, email, and message, then click "Send Message" to see an alert confirming submission.
- The design is fully responsive; resize the browser window to see layout adjustments.

**Enhancements from Previous Version** (if iterated)
- N/A for first iteration; future iterations could include interactive animations, a navigation menu, or linking the contact form to backend services.
